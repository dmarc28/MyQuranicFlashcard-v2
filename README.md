## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1) Create or open a repo on GitHub.
2) Upload **index.html** (this file) and optionally **amiri.woff2** (see below).
3) Go to **Settings â†’ Pages**.
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (root `/`)

Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Optional: Local Arabic Font
Drop **amiri.woff2** next to `index.html` for consistent Arabic rendering. The page will auto-use it if present (no code changes needed).
